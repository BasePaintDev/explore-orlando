                Welcome to my favorite local deli, where the owner greets me
                with a smile and a complimentary beer—because nothing says "I
                love my customers" like free booze! Conveniently located across
                the street from my former home, it is an ideal spot for
                delicious, affordable food.

              <p>
                The in-person hands-on labs were the best part of my time at
                Full Sail. As both a student and a mentor in these sessions, I
                picked up a crucial skill: understanding another programmer's
                logic. When my classmates hit a roadblock, instead of swooping
                in with my own brilliant (or possibly not-so-brilliant)
                solution, I focused on helping them tackle their coding
                conundrums. Clearing those pesky obstacles not only made their
                lives easier but also gave me new insights into problem-solving.

              <p>
                Lake Eola is a scenic destination for dog owners, families, and
                art lovers alike. The scenic path wraps around the lake, making
                it perfect for leisurely strolls—complete with waste stations,
                because let’s face it, no one enjoys a surprise “gift” while
                walking. Kids can run wild in a spacious playground, and the art
                installations sprinkled throughout add a delightful dash of
                creativity.
